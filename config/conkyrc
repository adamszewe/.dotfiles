LIFE GETS BETTER.
Are you better than Reto Meier ?
How bad do you want it ?
Study it as if your life depended on it.
It does.
If you are not getting better, 
   you are getting worse..
So I take steps to become better and better
    every day, 1% increase
If you are that good, 
   stop doing anything else
How can I afford that ?
 If you want to change your life, 
 change your words. Adopt the
 vocabulary of a rich person.
